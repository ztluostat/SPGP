## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->
The data analyzed in the paper consist of simulation data and precipitation data over the contiguous United States. The simulation data in Section 4 is generated via `R/generate_sim_data.R`. In Section 5, the data we used are average precipitation data aggregated from the daily data over October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018. The daily data are originally from the Global Historical Climate Network-Daily database, preprocessed by Dr. Mark Risser, and publicly available at his [personal website](https://sites.google.com/site/markdrisser/data-sets?authuser=0). We only focus on observations at 1939 stations located to the west of $90^\circ$W, which are available in `data/CONUS_precip_west_18.csv`.

## Availability

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

## Abstract

The model implementation and data analysis in the paper were done in R. The `R` folder provides code for 1) generating simulation inputs, 2) fitting SPGP to simulation and precipitation data via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), 3) Bayesian predictive inference of SPGP, 4) obtaining results from the competing method TGP, and 5) reproducing key figures and tables in the paper.

# Part 3: Reproducibility workflow

<!--
The materials provided should provide a straightforward way for reviewers and readers to reproduce analyses with as few steps as possible. 
-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [ ] Any numbers provided in text in the paper
- [ ] The computational method(s) presented in the paper (i.e., code is provided that implements the method(s))
- [ ] All tables and figures in the paper
- [x] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below: All tables and figures related to SPGP and its main competitor TGP in Section 4 (Simulation Studies) and Section 5 (Real Data Analysis) in the paper are reproduced in this workflow. Supplementary results to Sections 4 and 5, as provided in Sections S3.2 and S4 respectively in the Supplementary Materials, are also reproduced.

## Workflow

### Location

The workflow is available:

<!--
Check all that apply, and in the case of a Git repository include unique identifier, such as specific commit ID, branch, release, or tag.
-->
- [x] As part of the paper’s supplementary material.
- [ ] In this Git repository:
- [ ] Other (please specify):

<!--
Indicate where the materials (generally including the code, unless in a separate location and indicated in the previous section) are available. We strongly encourage authors to place their materials (but not large datasets) in a Git repository hosted on a site such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the repository is private during the review process, please indicate the location where it will be available publicly upon publication, and also include the materials as a zip file (e.g., obtained directly from the Git hosting site) as supplementary materials.
-->


### Format(s)

<!--
Check all that apply
-->
- [ ] Single master code file 
- [ ] Wrapper (shell) script(s)
- [x] Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
- [ ] Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Other (more detail in *Instructions* below)

### Instructions

All workflow information to reproduce key results of the paper is contained in `reproduce.Rmd`. The steps for running the workflow are:

**Step 1**: Install all required R packages in `dependencies.txt`.

**Step 2** (Optional): Compile the source code for the BRISC library by running the following command in your terminal:
```
R CMD SHLIB BRISC/BRISC.cpp BRISC/BRISC_Predict.cpp BRISC/util.cpp BRISC/init.c BRISC/lbfgs.c
```
This step is optional and only required if you want to re-run SPGP model fitting and prediction.

**Step 3** (Optional): Modify the options in Line 19-23 of `reproduce.Rmd` accordingly. By default, key figures and tables are reproduced from pre-computed model outputs in `data/`. To re-generate model outputs, make the following change(s):

* To re-generate simulation input data, set `gen_sim_input = TRUE`.

* To re-run SPGP model in simulation, set `fit_SPGP_sim = TRUE`.

* To re-run TGP model in simulation, set `fit_TGP_sim = TRUE`.

* To re-run SPGP model in precipitation data application, set `fit_SPGP_app = TRUE`.

* To re-run TGP model in precipitation data application, set `fit_TGP_app = TRUE`.

Please note that re-running these models can take several hours.

**Step 4**: Run the workflow in `reproduce.Rmd` by compiling the R Markdown file. For example, this can be done by running the following command in your terminal:
```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('reproduce.Rmd')"
```
Reproducible results can be found in the generated `reproduce.html` file.
